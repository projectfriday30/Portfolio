# 🚗 CO₂ Emissions Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project uses multiple linear regression to predict **CO₂ emissions** based on vehicle specifications.  
It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in the **automobile and environmental sectors**.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains information about vehicles: engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Visualization (pandas, matplotlib)
- Multiple Linear Regression (scikit-learn)
- Model Evaluation (R², MSE)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Strong correlation between fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions
- Regression model achieved high predictive accuracy
